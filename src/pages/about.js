            <p>12 years in the making! That’s how long since Steve Lambsden first got together with a bunch of low down hombres… OK then, fellow blues musicians. Foregoing the usual cover song formula he chose to fully indulge his true passion – Electric Blues. Through the band’s various incarnations, there have been various different versions, ranging from an acoustic trio thru a power quartet now, finally to the current twin guitar format.</p>

            <p>Lead Singer and Guitarist – Steve Lambsden, Harpist – Tony Smith, Drummer – Matt Greenfield, Bassist – Nodd McDonagh and Guitarist – Glen McPheat, all Sussex residents, comprise the current line-up of this Blues combo.</p>

            <p>Steve’s phat guitar tones and emotive vocals, Glen’s angular guitar, (a touch of Winged Eel Fingerling) and more anxious vocal style, Tony’s hollering and howling harp all provide different directions for the melody to develop. None of this would work if not for the dynamic and driving rhythm section – Matt’s clockwork timing and precise fills locked into Nodd’s driving and evolving bass lines together with the introduction of his EUB keep it all on track, and he’s started singing too. All of this achieved with the almost supernatural intuition amongst the players, always a hallmark of the Blues Issue, that and the clear sense that they love what they do!</p>

            <p>The band offers a much more layered and syncopated sound palette. The set features both imaginatively re-arranged versions of blues ‘standards’. Now the set has developed and includes many of the band’s own songs. Initially, these were developed from Steve’s creative fount as evidenced by the rootsy rhythms of their eponymous opus “That Old Blues Issue”, the syncopated soul of ‘Everything but Love”, the driving express that is “Blues Train”. Recent additions have originated from Glen and Nodd both and include both featured on vocals, songs that take new takes on the blues, lyrically and rhythmically.</p>

            <p>They have by now played most of the usual English South Coast blues haunts; they retain a deep enthusiasm for the roots blues scene, as evidenced by their many sweat drenched pub gigs. The repeat appearances at Swanage Blues Festivals have led on to a number of ‘large stage’ performances at various Blues and Rock festivals and to their debut at Skegness 2018 Great British Rock and Blues Festival.    As you will see they have no problem covering the bigger stage spaces, nor getting bigger new audiences going with their infectious and extrovert performances.</p>

            <p>July 2013 saw the release of the first BI album “Bad Day for the Blues” showcasing a wide range of Blues hues. Their 2015 follow up “Late Edition” has had numerous radio plays and saw the band reach a higher level of sound and reputation. The latest collection “99 Troubles” is already in rehearsal. It will feature a wider range of musical contributions from band members and with award-winning Catfish keyboardist and BBC producer Paul Long at the production helm the band hopes to capture their nuclear fission on tape…well, hard disk actually. Due for release June 2018.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading this; we hope to see you at a gig soon!</p>
